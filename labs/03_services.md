## Your first Angular service

### Create a FlightService

In this exercise you will develop a `FlightService` that takes over the communication with the Flight API via HTTPS and use it within your component:

```
[FlightSearchComponent] --> [FlightService]
```

To do this, you can follow the points below or just look up if necessary.

1. Create a service in the _flight-search_ folder. The file for this service should be named _flight.service.ts_.

2. Implement a _FlightService_ in that file, which requests the flights required by the application. The service must have the _HttpClient_ injected (and imported) to do its job.

    <details>
    <summary>Show source</summary>
    <p>

   ```typescript
   @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
   export class FlightService {
     constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

     find(from: string, to: string): Observable<Flight[]> {
       const url = 'http://www.angular.at/api/flight';
       const headers = new HttpHeaders().set('Accept', 'application/json');
       const params = new HttpParams().set('from', from).set('to', to);

       return this.http.get<Flight[]>(url, { headers, params });
     }
   }
   ```

    </p>
    </details>

   In case you did bonus task _Edit flights_ above, you must now also outsource the _save_ method to the service.

    <details>
    <summary>Show source</summary>
    <p>

   ```typescript
   save(flight: Flight): Observable<Flight> {
     const url = 'http://www.angular.at/api/flight';
     const headers = new HttpHeaders().set('Accept', 'application/json');

     return this.http.post<Flight>(url, flight, { headers });
   }
   ```

    </p>
    </details>

3. Open the _flight-search.component.ts_ file and inject the new service into the constructor. Make sure the corresponding import was added!

   <details>
   <summary>Show source</summary>
   <p>

   ```typescript
   […]
   export class FlightSearchComponent {
     […]
     constructor(private flightService: FlightService) {}
     […]
   }
   ```

   </p>
   </details>

4. Use the injected _FlightService_ in the _search_ method to search for flights.

   <details>
   <summary>Show source</summary>
   <p>

   ```typescript
   search(): void {
     this.flightService.find(this.from, this.to)
       .subscribe({
         next: (flights) => {
           this.flights = flights;
         },
         error: (errResp) => {
           console.error('Error loading flights', errResp);
         }
       });
   }
   ```

   </p>
   </details>

5. Test your solution in the browser.

6. Make sure with the DevTools debugger that the _FlightService_ gets the _HttpClient_ injected first and then the component gets the _FlightService_ in the same way.

7. If you did the edit flights bonus task use the flight service for saving the flight as well.

### Bonus: Alternate Implementation \*

1. Create a new file with an `AbstractFlightService` in the _flight-search_ folder:

   ```typescript
   export abstract class AbstractFlightService {
     abstract find(from: string, to: string): Observable<Flight[]>;
   }
   ```

2. Switch to the _flight.service.ts_ file and let _FlightService_ implement the _AbstractFlightService_ class:

   ```typescript
   @Injectable({ [...] })
   export class FlightService implements AbstractFlightService {
     […]
   }
   ```

   The keyword _implements_ indicates that the _FlightService_ must implement all methods of the _AbstractFlightServices_. In contrast to the keyword _extends_, however, there is no inheritance.

3. Switch to the app.module.ts file and create a provider for the AbstractFlightService:

   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     [...],
     providers: [
       {
         provide: AbstractFlightService,
         useClass: FlightService
       }
     ],
     [...]
   })
   export class AppModule { }
   ```

4. Request an instance of _AbstractFlightService_ **instead** of an instance of _FlightService_ in your component via dependency injection:

   <details>
   <summary>Show source</summary>
   <p>

   ```typescript
   private flightService = inject(AbstractFlightService);
   ```

   </p>
   </details>

   <br>

5. Test your solution.

6. Create a _dummy-flight.service.ts_ file in the _flight-search_ folder.

7. Provide an alternative implementation of _AbstractFlightService_ in this file. This should be called _DummyFlightService_ and return a few hard-coded flights for testing:

   ```typescript
   import { of } from 'rxjs';
   […]

   @Injectable()
   export class DummyFlightService implements AbstractFlightService {
     find(from: string, to: string): Observable<Flight[]> {
       return of([{id: 17, from: 'Graz', to: 'Hamburg', date: '2022-01-01', delayed: true}]);
     }
   }
   ```

   The _of_ function shown here creates an observable that returns the transferred array with flights.

8. Now let your `AbstractFlightService` refer to the new ` DummyFlightService`.

   <details>
   <summary>Show source</summary>
   <p>

   ```typescript
   @NgModule({
     [...],
     providers: [
       {
         provide: AbstractFlightService,
         useClass: DummyFlightService
       }
     ],
     [...]
   })
   export class AppModule { }
   ```

   </p>
   </details>

   <br>

9. Test your solution and make sure that the new _DummyFlightService_ is used.

10. Change the service registration again so that you can send the original _FlightService_ to all consumers who request the _AbstractFlightService_:

    ```typescript
    @NgModule({
      [...],
      providers: [
        {
          provide: AbstractFlightService,
          useClass: FlightService
        }
      ],
      [...]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
    ```

### Bonus: useFactory \*\*

With `useFactory` you can specify a factory function that specifies how your service is to be created

```typescript
@NgModule({
  [...],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: AbstractFlightService,
      useFactory: (http: HttpClient) => new FlightService(http),
      deps: [HttpClient]
    }
  ],
  [...]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Create a constant `DEBUG` in this file, which can be either `true` or `false`. Change the factory so that, depending on ` DEBUG`, it returns either the `FlightService` (` DEBUG === false`) or the `DummyFlightService` (`DEBUG === true`).
